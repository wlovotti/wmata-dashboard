# NOTES-20. Tighter rider-experience OTP

Backend half tracked as NOTES-144; UI toggle ships with NOTES-143.

**Severity: low (deferred).**

User considers WMATA's −2 / +7 window lax but wants comparability with
WMATA's published scorecard for now. Future option: expose a stricter
"rider-experience OTP" alongside the official one (e.g., −60s / +180s)
for non-frequent routes (frequent routes get EWT instead — see `src/ewt.py`).
The constants live in `src/otp_constants.py`, so this is a one-line
change — could even be a query-parameter toggle on the API.
