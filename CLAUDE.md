## Project Overview

WMATA Performance Dashboard - A transit metrics dashboard for Washington DC Metro bus and rail lines, inspired by the TransitMatters Dashboard. The project collects real-time vehicle position data from WMATA's GTFS feeds and computes performance metrics (OTP, headways, speeds) via a FastAPI backend.

## Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- **Python 3.9+** with `uv` for package management
- **SQLAlchemy** for ORM and database operations
- **SQLite** for local development (PostgreSQL-ready for production)
- **FastAPI** for REST API backend
- **GTFS & GTFS-RT** for transit data (static schedules + real-time positions)
- **protobuf** for parsing GTFS-RT vehicle position feeds
- **NumPy** for vectorized array operations (performance-critical calculations)
- **ruff** for code linting and formatting

**Frontend:**
- **React 18** with Vite build tool
- **React Router** for client-side navigation
- **Recharts** for data visualization (trend charts)
- **React Leaflet** for interactive maps
- **WMATA Brand Guidelines** for colors and typography

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **GTFS Static Data** → Downloaded from WMATA API (routes, stops, trips, stop_times, shapes)
2. **GTFS-RT Data** → Polled every 60s from WMATA API (vehicle positions)
3. **Database** → Stores both static schedule data and real-time position snapshots
4. **Nightly Batch Job** → `pipelines/compute_daily_metrics.py` computes daily metrics
5. **Aggregation Tables** → Pre-computed metrics stored in `route_metrics_daily` and `route_metrics_summary`
6. **API** → FastAPI serves pre-computed metrics with <100ms response times
7. **Frontend** → React dashboard with route scorecard, detail pages, charts, and maps

### Database Models (`src/models.py`)

**Static Data (GTFS):**
- **Route**: Static GTFS routes (125 routes in WMATA system)
- **Stop**: Static GTFS stops (7,505 stops)
- **Trip**: Static GTFS trips (~130k trips representing scheduled service)
- **StopTime**: Static GTFS stop_times (scheduled arrival/departure at each stop, ~5.5M records)
- **Shape**: GTFS shapes data defining vehicle paths (503k points for accurate distance/speed calculations)
- **Agency, Calendar, CalendarDate, FeedInfo, Timepoint, TimepointTime**: Additional GTFS static data tables

**Real-time Data:**
- **VehiclePosition**: Real-time vehicle snapshots from GTFS-RT with ALL 17 fields including lat/lon, speed, bearing, occupancy, trip details (PRIMARY DATA SOURCE)
- **BusPosition**: WMATA BusPositions API data with deviation field (SUPPLEMENTARY - validation shows unreliable deviation data)

**Aggregation Tables (Pre-computed Metrics):**
- **RouteMetricsDaily**: Daily performance metrics for each route (OTP, headway, speed) - populated by nightly batch job
- **RouteMetricsSummary**: Rolling 7-day summary for each route - used by API scorecard endpoint for fast responses

Key relationships:
- Routes → Trips → StopTimes → Stops (static schedule data)
- VehiclePosition → Route/Trip (real-time observations - primary)
- BusPosition → Route/Trip (WMATA proprietary API - supplementary only)

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env` file:
- `WMATA_API_KEY`: API key from https://developer.wmata.com (rate limit: 10 calls/sec, 50k/day)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Optional, defaults to SQLite `./wmata_dashboard.db`, use PostgreSQL URI for production

## Performance Optimizations

### API Performance
- **Pre-computed Aggregations**: Nightly batch job computes metrics once, API reads from tables
- **Response Time**: 37ms for scorecard endpoint (vs 30+ seconds for live calculation)
- **Speedup**: ~1000x improvement by separating computation from serving

### Analytics Performance
- **Route Stops Caching**: 100x+ performance improvement for multi-route analysis
- **Trip Matching Fast Path**: ~90% of matches use RT trip_id directly (no position/time matching needed)
- **Batch Loading**: Load all stops/trips upfront rather than individual queries
- **NumPy Vectorization**: Use numpy arrays for distance/speed calculations (speed segments: ~10x faster)

### Frontend Performance
- **Speed Segments Disabled by Default**: Heavy calculation disabled by default, only computed on-demand
- **Pre-computation Philosophy**: Heavy calculations done in offline pipelines, not live in API endpoints
- **Database Considerations**: SQLite has write lock limitations (pause collection during dev), PostgreSQL required for production

**Next Steps (Priority Order):**

1. **Production Deployment** (Next Priority)
   - Deploy to cloud platform (DigitalOcean, AWS, Heroku, etc.)
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Configure continuous data collection (systemd service or cloud scheduler)
   - Set up cron jobs for nightly metrics computation
   - Set up weekly GTFS refresh
   - Configure reverse proxy (Nginx or cloud provider)
   - Set up SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt or cloud provider)
   - Build and serve frontend static files
   - Implement monitoring and alerting

2. **Data Retention & Archival**
   - Implement data archival strategy (keep raw 60s data for 2-4 weeks)
   - Aggregate older data to 5-10 minute averages
   - Set up automated cleanup jobs
   - Target steady-state storage: ~1-2 GB

3. **Frontend Enhancements**
   - Add date range selectors for trend charts
   - Improve responsive design for mobile devices
   - Add loading states and error handling improvements
   - Export functionality (CSV, JSON downloads)

4. **API Enhancements**
   - Add pagination for large result sets
   - Add date range filtering parameters
   - Add caching layer (Redis) for frequently accessed data
   - Add API rate limiting
   - Add API authentication/authorization (if needed)

5. **Advanced Analytics & Features**
   - Automated bus bunching alerts
   - Service gap identification and alerting
   - Route reliability scoring (beyond just OTP)
   - Comparative route analysis dashboard
   - Historical performance comparisons (month-over-month, year-over-year)
   - Email/SMS alerts for service disruptions

**Important Notes:**
- **GTFS-based OTP is PRIMARY** - Don't use WMATA deviation as sole source (validation showed up to 7.7 min discrepancies)
- WMATA's GTFS-RT trip_ids DO match GTFS static trip_ids (100% match rate verified)
- All RT trip_ids have complete stop_times data in GTFS static (56-57 stops per trip typical for C51)
- Trip matching prioritizes RT trip_id for accuracy and performance (~90% fast path usage)
- Position/time-based matching serves as fallback for edge cases where RT trip_id is invalid
- Never infer the planned schedule from actual vehicle position data - always use GTFS static data
- BusPositions API useful for cross-validation and schedule discrepancy detection
- **Pre-computed aggregations are critical for API performance** - never calculate metrics live in API endpoints
- **When adding new functionality**, consider whether calculation is expensive; if so, use offline pre-computation
- Run nightly batch job to keep metrics up to date
- **SQLite database locking**: For development, pause data collection when using API/dashboard (write locks block reads)
- **PostgreSQL required for production** to support concurrent collection and API queries
- **60-second collection frequency is optimal** - provides good data quality with minimal API usage (1,440/50,000 daily limit)
- **22.75% match rate is expected and healthy** - buses spend 75-80% of time between stops, not at them

**Key Findings:**
- ~40% of bus arrivals are early (real operational pattern, not data error)
- LA Metro OTP standard (-1 to +5 min) is stricter than WMATA's published standard
- Polling-based collection gives ±30-60 second accuracy (acceptable for trend analysis)
- Route stops caching provides 100x+ performance improvement for multi-route analysis
- API response time: 37ms with pre-computed aggregations (vs 30+ seconds with live calculation)
- NumPy vectorization: ~10x speedup for speed segment calculations (3.4M → 350K operations)
- Speed segments disabled by default in frontend to avoid performance issues on route detail pages
- Match rate analysis shows 60s collection frequency is optimal:
  - Overall: 22.75% match rate (expected - buses between stops most of the time)
  - Top routes: 45-50% match rate (excellent for high-frequency service)
  - 256 positions per vehicle per day provides excellent temporal resolution
  - Less frequent collection (2-3 min) would lose 30-50% of matched arrivals

## Git Workflow

- **Never commit directly to main** - Always create feature branches
- Branch naming: `feature/description`, `fix/description`
- Create PR and merge to main after review
- All PRs run through GitHub Actions checks (ruff linting, import tests)

## Code Style

- Use **ruff** for linting and formatting (configured in pyproject.toml)
- Python 3.9+ type hints: Use `list[dict]` instead of `List[Dict]`
- Line length: 100 characters
- Import sorting: Automatic via ruff
- All code must pass `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` before merging

## Session Notes

  - Time-period performance analysis
- **API**: All endpoints complete and performant (37ms response time)
- **Pipeline**: Processing 103 routes, computing all metrics including bunching detection
- **Data**: System-wide collection at 60s intervals (~550-630 vehicles/minute)

**Data Collection Analysis:**
- **Match Rate**: 22.75% overall (expected - buses spend most time between stops)
- **Top Routes**: 45-50% match rates (F20, D80, C53)
- **Collection Volume**: 243,016 positions → 55,275 arrivals per week
- **Temporal Resolution**: 256 positions per vehicle per day
- **API Usage**: 1,440 calls/day (well within 50,000/day limit)
- **Conclusion**: 60-second intervals optimal - less frequent would lose 30-50% of data

**Ready for Production:**
- All core features implemented and tested
- Frontend and backend fully integrated
- API endpoints complete and performant
- Data collection strategy validated and optimized
- Documentation updated and comprehensive
- Match rate analysis confirms current approach is optimal
- NumPy vectorization provides ~10x speedup for distance/proximity calculations
